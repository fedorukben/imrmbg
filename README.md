# Image Background Remover

This tool is an image background remover. It allows you to input an image file and output the file with the background set to transparent. 

Due to file type restrictions, the supported output file types include PNG, TIF, WEBP, and GIF.

The tool was built in Rust. It is not perfect, but should allow removal of some white background without using an online tool.
